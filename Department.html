<h2><a name="BEL" href="DoElectricalE.html">Bachelor Of Electrical Engineering</a> </h2>

<p>
<img src='images/dept/ee.jpg' style='float:right;'>
Electrical engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. 
The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century with the commercialization of the electric telegraph and electrical power supply. 
The field now covers a range of sub-disciplines including those that deal with power, optoelectronics, digital electronics, analog electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, control systems, electronics, signal processing and telecommunications.

<h2><a name="BIM" href="DoIM.html">Bachelor Of Information Management</a></h2>

<p>
<img src='images/dept/im.jpg'>
With computerization and advent of small electronic forms of holding data, it became essential for organizations to have ‘control of information’ with easy access to it as well.
 It was realized that the form in which information is presented and how it is interpreted could assist in the decision making process at a strategic level, contributing to competitive advantage.
 It also helped provide cost effective added value and good customer service.
 Hence, was born the concept of information management which recognized the importance of integrating essential elements of accounting, statistics and business information systems to produce viable Human Resource Management Systems to be strategically aligned with the business strategy.
