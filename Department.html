<h2><a name="BCT" href="DoComputerE.html">Department Of Computer Engineering</a> </h2>

<p>
Computer Engineering is the study, design, and analysis of computer systems. 
The discipline covers the general concepts of hardware and software.
 The main fields of study include software engineering, computer networks, distributed and parallel computing, computer graphics, multimedia systems, embedded systems, cryptography, security, privacy, database management and information retrieval, artificial intelligence and knowledge based systems and bioinformatics.

</p>


<h2><a name="BEL" href="DoElectricalE.html">Department Of Electrical Engineering</a> </h2>

<p>
Electrical engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. 
The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century with the commercialization of the electric telegraph and electrical power supply. 
The field now covers a range of sub-disciplines including those that deal with power, optoelectronics, digital electronics, analog electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, control systems, electronics, signal processing and telecommunications.



</p>
<h2><a name="BEX" href="DoElectronicsE.html">Department Of Electronics Engineering</a></h2>

<p>
Welcome to the Department of Electronic Engineering.
 The Department produces skillful technicians capable of assisting the design, production, operating and service of electronic system and equipment with an emphasis on the practical areas of communications and information.
 Students are encouraged to participate in contests and accreditation tests to become certified technicians  
 We are proud to say that, as a Department, we are consistently ranked as among the best Electronic Engineering Departments within the NEPAL.
 Arguably we are the very best, having extremely strong metrics in both elements of our core business, teaching and research. 
 In taught programmes, students at all levels have the support of a named personal tutor.
We offer professionally accredited BEng, MEng, and MSc courses.
Our degrees develop the knowledge and professional skills of our students, for careers that lead the future development of electronics, communications and computing technologies.
</p>

<h2><a name="BIT" href="DoIT.html">Department Of Information technology</a> </h2>

<p>
The Information Technology Department is dedicated to delivering high quality technical service to the students, employees and community.
 It is our goal to continuously meet the technological needs of all LFTC students, staff, faculty and visitors.
 We currently maintain all the computer labs, along with work stations in the library and Student Support Services office.

<h2><a name="BIM" href="DoIM.html">Department Of Information management</a></h2>

<p>
With computerization and advent of small electronic forms of holding data, it became essential for organizations to have ‘control of information’ with easy access to it as well.
 It was realized that the form in which information is presented and how it is interpreted could assist in the decision making process at a strategic level, contributing to competitive advantage.
 It also helped provide cost effective added value and good customer service.
 Hence, was born the concept of information management which recognized the importance of integrating essential elements of accounting, statistics and business information systems to produce viable Human Resource Management Systems to be strategically aligned with the business strategy.
